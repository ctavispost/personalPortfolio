    <p><a href="https://github.com/ctavispost/moodPatch_frontend" target="_blank">Moodpatch</a> is a colorful, mobile-first mood tracking app. People can enter their own moods, edit or delete them, and keep track of them over time. So that they know they are not alone, people can also see anonymous moods from other users.</p>

    <p>I designed and developed moodpatch in 6 days.</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Constructing and debugging this app taught me to approach things in chunks. My fastest and best progress came when I made incremental improvements and additions, and where I debugged function by function or line by line.</p>
