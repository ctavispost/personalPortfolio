## Profile
{:.margBottZero .smallerBreak .underlineBlock}

From my lifelong passion for illustration, to customer service, to writing for child advocacy, I have seen that the right synthesis of form and function helps us solve problems, help people, and make the world a more interesting place. I create open, accessible design based on research and dialogue. With broad, practical empathy and a deep curiosity, I work across disciplines to design experiences that improve services and help people.
