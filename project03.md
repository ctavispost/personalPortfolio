Dauntlez is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending domestic violence and abuse by educating and empowering women, teens, and parents. They run workshops teaching physical defense, awareness, and de-escalation to women, teens, and parents. I launched Dautnlez.org with a team of 10 other people at a 6 hour hackathon.

Working from discussions with the product owner and information from an earlier site, Dauntlez.com, we collaborated on a completely new design. I created and refined content, information architecture, and UI artifacts which I deployed to new pages on WordPress. I also championed accessibility and a focus on users' goals.

At the end of the day, we had a site which let people sign up for classes, donate, and learn the 'what' and 'why' of Dauntlez.

<h2 class="centerGrid" markdown="1">What's next for Dauntlez.org?</h2>

The site needs a working volunteer page, a calendar, and more information for fundraising. All images showing information should have text or graphs added separately to make them accessible. Once essential elements are seen to, Dauntlez could use some research to better serve its community and improve its UI, especially navigation.

Possible future additions might include videos, online courses, more details about what is taught in each workshop, and stronger fundraising copy.
