#[Dauntlez.org](https://dauntlez.org)

Dauntlez is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending domestic violence and abuse by educating and empowering women, teens, and parents. I launched Dautnlez.org with a team of 10 other people at a 6 hour hackathon.

Working from discussions with the product owner and information from an earlier site, Dauntlez.com, we collaborated on a completely new design. I created and refined content, information architecture, and UI artifacts which I deployed to new pages on WordPress. I also championed accessibility and a focus on users' goals.

At the end of the day, we had a site which let people sign up for classes, learn the 'what' and 'why' of Dauntlez, and offer to volunteer.

Working with the product owner and 9 other volunteers, I designed and deployed Dauntlez.org. I crafted the information architecture, layout, and content based on essential user needs and the organization's goals.
