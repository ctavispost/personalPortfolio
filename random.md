    <p>The novel barona virus outbreak continues aboard ship, and we find ourselves unsocially distancing to avoid contamination. Commander Spiker remains useless, even more so now, as he has no one to dose but himself.</p>

    <p>As morale falters, and with only a skeleton crew to run the ship, we have been tasked with meeting a Klingbong delegation who claim their native strain of ganja can cure the illness. Though I have my doubts, I can only hope they are right.</p>
