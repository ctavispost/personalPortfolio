    <p>The novel barona virus outbreak continues aboard ship, and we find ourselves unsocially distancing to avoid contamination. Commander Spiker remains useless, even more so now, as he has no one to dose but himself.</p>

    <p>All bars, taverns, and pubs have been closed. Much to the crew's disappointment, even the orgy dome of Bend Forward is sealed shut.</p>

    <p>As morale falters, and with only a skeleton crew to run the ship, we have been tasked with meeting a Klingbong delegation who claim their native strain of ganja can cure the illness. Though I have my doubts, I can only hope they are right.</p>

  <p>Henceforth, 'blandishment' should mean 'becoming bland, being made commonplace or unremarkable, or a state of mundanity' (and should in no way be associated with alluring, coaxing, or persuasion except in fantasy novels and renaissance fairs).</p>

  <p>–This is in line with its origin, where the Latin word meant 'mild' as well as 'flattering'.–</p>

  <p>Shortly after breakfast one morning, my little child turned to me and declared, "Dadda, I'm hungry, and I don't want fruit." We had apples, cherries, raspberries, and blueberries at hand.</p>

  <p>"If you say you're hungry, but you won't eat fruit you like, you aren't hungry," I informed him. "We've had this conversation before."</p>

  <p>"But not today," he replied.</p>

  <p>Climbing Everest is a bit like drinking heroic amounts of whiskey:</p>
