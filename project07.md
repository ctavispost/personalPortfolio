    <p>Andromeda TechConnect (ATC) brings people and events together in the tech space. The landing page shows upcoming events and lets users sign up for more information. Users' information is then stored in a SQL database. The admin dashboard simply displays users' names and emails.</p>

    <p>ATC was made by a team of designers (Ulysse Worsfold, Shaina Lieh, and Vince Tran) and developers (<a href="https://github.com/tbisho" target="_blank">T.B.</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TeddySpaghet" target="_blank">Theodore Pochart</a>, and C. Tavis Post) in an 8 hour online collabathon at General Assembly.</p>

          I worked alongside my teammates to develop this app. Outside of pair programming, my focus was on frontend elements, working with EJS, CSS, and Materialize CSS.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>People want to be informed of upcoming tech events, and promoters want to know how to contact possible attendees.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="medBreak">
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Andromeda TechConnect lets users see upcoming events and sign up for updates. It then adds users' contact info to a SQL database accessible by admins via an easy to read dashboard.</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Having some experience UX, it was interesting to work as a developer with a team of designers. Seeing their processes from the outside, while working to quickly code a solution reminded me just how important strong communication between partners is.</p>

    <p>This was true for the coding process as well. About half of what we did was pair programming, but we also had to split up work. We worked hard to ensure there were few coding conflicts and little wasted time.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Information about actual tech events using an API</li>
      <li>Social media sharing</li>
