    <h1 class="aboutText lessLeading">I'm Tavis,</h1>

    <p class="aboutText">and I love storytelling and making a difference for people. I blend my unique backgrounds in art, retail, and social services with technical skills in content, development, and design to help make things which help people.</p>

    <p class="aboutText">From my lifelong passion for illustration to my work as a writing consultant in child advocacy cases, I have seen that the right synthesis of form and function helps us solve problems, help people, and make the world a more interesting place.</p>

    <p class="aboutText">If you have big ideas for how you want your organization to interact with people online, especially if that would help people in need, I would love to talk with you about how that could happen. If you want to connect to share stories and experiences, I’ll gratefully listen.</p>
