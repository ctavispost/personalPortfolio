  <p>Based upon survey responses and personal conversations, I created three personas to help guide future decisions.</p>

  <article class="medBreak personaCard">
    <header>
      <h3 class="headerWithP">Phil</h3>
      <p>retail manager and photo enthusiast</p>
    </header>

    <img src="images/jotAnd/personaPhil.jpg" alt="Phil and his Nikon camera" class="smallPic">

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Motivations:</h4>
    <p>Images take up most of Phil’s storage. He would like one service with a large amount of space for saving and sharing photos alongside comments.</p>

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Goals:</h4>
    <p>Phil wants to post directly to social networks or link others to a page with equal ease. He needs to be able to document incidents, combining photos and writing, and to collaborate on these with the rest of his team.</p>

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Frustrations:</h4>
    <p>Phil wishes his uploads were faster. He doesn’t like pop-over messages suggesting he upgrade service. He doesn’t want to use email to discuss photos he’s shared.</p>

  <article class="medBreak personaCard">
    <header>
      <h3 class="headerWithP">Adrienne</h3>
      <p>UX designer</p>
    </header>

    <img src="images/jotAnd/personaAdrienne.jpg" alt="Adrienne standing outside at night" class="smallPic">

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Motivations:</h4>
    <p>Adrienne works with images, written documents, and forms across various apps. She spends more time than she would like trying to organize things.</p>

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Goals:</h4>
    <p>She wants to be able to quickly and easily find, organize, and share files online.</p>

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Frustrations:</h4>
    <p>Adrienne wishes photo sorting and sharing was more enjoyable. She doesn’t like the amount of time it can take to find a particular picture.</p>

  <article class="medBreak personaCard">
    <header>
      <h3 class="headerWithP">Jean</h3>
      <p>illustrator and graphic designer</p>
    </header>

    <img src="images/jotAnd/personaJean.jpg" alt="Jean smiling in sunglasses" class="smallPic">

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Motivations:</h4>
    <p>Jean sends clients moodboards, storyboards, and iterative sketches with notes. He keeps his projects organized.</p>

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Goals:</h4>
    <p>Jean would like a single service from which to share and organize files. He needs to be able to attach notes to illustrations (without distracting from them) and to let clients respond or change files in real time.</p>

    <h4 class="smallLeading">Frustrations:</h4>
    <p>Jean doesn’t like available mobile apps and finds them difficult to manage. He is unsatisfied with the current file layouts and organization; he would like more visual and structured options.</p>

    </p>
  </header>

  <p>Referring to the surveys and personas, I made user stories for potential, new, returning, and administrative users. High priority tasks became the basis for acceptance of the MVP. Medium priority tasks were rendered nice-to-haves. Low priorities were ignored.</p>

  <p>Administrator tasks were not included in the MVP, but should be considered for future development.</p>

  <p>Drawing logical connections between tasks in the user flows, I drew up a site map, and began to verbally lay out the app and landing page.</p>

  <p>To establish product tone, I sketched dummy wireframes, logos, and word association lists. I tried out several names, settling on the flexibility and invitational promise of 'jot &'.</p>

  <p>These artifacts became the skeleton for my wireframes.</p>

    <img src="images/jotAnd/lapFrame.png" alt="wireframe of a file dashboard in grid view" class="centerImg">
  </div>

  <p class="smBreak">I began sketching wireframes at a fairly high level before transitioning to dummying pages in Figma.</p>

  <p>As I began to build out wireframes, the project ballooned with the creation of dozens of eventually discarded pages. Exact steps in processes turned out to be hard to pin down, and as I made changes in one place, it became difficult to maintain consistency.</p>

  <p>This taught me to start with atomic components before building outwards. I should have paid more attention to the smaller details first, built repeatable pieces, and then moved on to full screens and higher level processes.</p>

  <section class="medBreak"> <!-- prototype -->

      <h2 class="headerWithP">Lo-fi prototype</h2>

      </p>
    </header>

    <p>After working out many of the problems in the static screens, I began to compose a clickable prototype. This turned out to be one of the hardest and most demanding sections of my work. I ended up making hundreds of pages of material while running into previously unknown constraints in Figma.</p>

    <p>I eventually dropped many responses to user input (such as hover states in menus or above icons), making the prototype less interactive than planned in order to achieve functionality.</p>

    <p>I continued to replace individual pieces with components and struggled to standardize my screens.</p>

    <p>I began with a large set of screens for my desktop version (1440px width), and had to work backwards to make each desktop page responsive and to size things down for mobile screens. This order was backwards. In the future, I intend to start with the smallest breakpoints (beginning in mobile) and to build from there.</p>

      </p>
    </header>

    <p>Three people were asked to look at a wireframe prototype of the jot & landing page and then:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Sign up for the app and take its tour</li>
      <li>Upload a folder, and create and name another folder</li>
      <li>Delete one file, and move a folder</li>
      <li>Open a note, in which they:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload, resize, and caption a photo</li>
        <li>Write in the note</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <section class="smBreak"> <!-- tester 1, Alex -->
      <header>
        <h4 class="headerWithP">Alex</h4>
        <p>36 y.o., female, Product Manager</p>
        <p>in person</p>
      </header>

      <p>Alex learned how the system worked, successfully completing each task, and was able to apply the same approach to similar tasks, but was not always satisfied with the methods. In particular, the overflow menu was problematic and the ‘new’/plus menu was not immediately obvious to her.</p>
    </section> <!-- end tester 1, Alex -->

    <section class="smBreak"> <!-- tester 2, Emma -->
      <header>
        <h4 class="headerWithP">Emma</h4>
        <p>65 y.o., female, Social Worker</p>
        <p>video conference</p>
      </header>

      <p>There were a number of pain points which left Emma unsure and made it difficult to move confidently through jot &. Without a ‘next’ button on tour pages, she wasn’t sure how to proceed. The connection between ‘upload’ and saving a file to the cloud was unclear to her. Using the overflow menu to delete or move objects was not obvious–she wanted to click on items and have the relevant options appear. Similar issues persisted in the notepad. The program was basically broken for her.</p>
    </section> <!-- end tester 2, Emma -->

    <section class="smBreak"> <!-- tester 3, Ken -->
      <header>
        <h4 class="headerWithP">Ken</h4>
        <p>68 y.o., male, retired Lawyer and Banker</p>
        <p>video conference</p>
      </header>

      <p>Ken wanted a more explicitly guided experience, with clearer actions. He had similar issues to Alex and Emma above.</p>

        <h3>Resultant action</h3>
      </header>

      <p>The testers were able to navigate the landing page and sign up easily. However, the onboarding tour and empty-state screen posed problems. Alleviating fear was the most important thing I had to do after testing.</p>

      <div class="centerGrid grid2Col respImgGrid">
        <figure>
          <img src="images/jotAnd/wireTour03.jpg" alt="a wireframe tour screen pointing out the navbar" class="centerImg">

        </figure>

          <figcaption>improved tour screen</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>Improved tour directions and the addition of buttons to advance the tour let users ease in to the experience.</p>

      <p>I had assumed older users would be more comfortable using a drop-down menu system, this was not true. Instead, testers found the overflow menu confusing. They wanted the actions to be accessed by pressing an item itself. I followed their guidance. This helped diminish user fear and streamlined the process of acting on files and folders.</p>

      <p>Testers wanted more of an indication of when they were in a note and where the note workspace was. So I emboldened the bread crumbs and added a transition animation between storage and notes before moving on to visual design.</p>
