    <h1>The future of <span>jot &amp</span></h1>
  </header>

  <p>This is a complete MVP, which could be coded, tested, and delivered as a desktop web app. There is room for improvement, and more testing could done. In particular, the mobile version should go through user testing and be reiterated on.</p>

  <p>I would also like to see A/B tests for placement of the ‘new’-plus button, to see if it might be more effective in the navbar than at the upper right of the page.</p>

  <p>Future features might include automatically formatting photo collections and folders in automated notes, and a second, enlarged grid view with previews of items. Administrative tools should be considered for a second release to expand the user-base by addressing business and team use-cases.</p>

  <p>Finally, a microblog-style feed showing publicly shared notes might add further interactive and social elements, increasing user engagement.</p>

    <h1>What I learned</h1>
  </header>

  <p>After working my way through problems caused by not having built components or a pattern library early on, I realized I should focus on atomic elements first and build outwards. High-level sketches are useful starting points, but it’s important to sweat the details early on, even though they will undergo multiple iterations.</p>

  <p>In testing my wireframe prototype, I was surprised to find a uniform desire to interact with items instead of menus. I had assumed older people would be more used to a slightly more manual approach, but even those who had little or no experience with touch interfaces still intuitively wanted to click on items when asked to delete them, for example. This lead me to drop several options from the ellipsis menu, and focus on making items more interactive.</p>

  <p>I also learned the challenges of working without project management standards in place. This took longer and was more difficult than it could have been with greater structure in processes and approach, as in agile–a practice I found helpful in building this site.</p>
