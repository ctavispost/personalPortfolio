  <p>Based on user and persona needs, jot &'s primary values are creativity, communication, and dependability. Its promotional copy points to togetherness, sharing, memories, fun, and ease, while leaving room for business and work. There is a quiet emphasis on personal empowerment and ‘saving’.</p>

  <p>The brand color, a bright violet, mixes work and play. The brand copy of Poppins sets a jaunty, bold feel, while the body copy of Open Sans reassures with professionalism and reliability. Jot &’s logo brings all of this together in a playful, geometric combination of the brand name, a camera, and a stylus.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/BvOs1gYiZ40By1v86qFXTL/cloudRefine">mockup</a></p>
  </header>

  <p>With the branding set, I began to apply it to create a mockup from my wireframes in Figma.</p>

  <p>First, I found free images which matched the brand, illustrated them in Autodesk Sketchbook (iOS), simplified the images in Adobe Illustrator, and added them to the landing and features pages.</p>

  <p>To create a more straightforward experience I simplified pages, reset type, and added color while increasing consistency and whitespace, continuing this approach throughout the rest of the design process.</p>

    </header>

    <p>While working on my mockup, I built connections between pages and components for a Figma prototype. I tested its features during this process upon changes, and again before user testing. There weren’t any big surprises this time, just minor bugs I fixed before moving on to testing.</p>

    </header>

    <p>I conducted three informal, in-person, qualitative tests to look into the branding, copy, visual design, and functionality of my prototype. These resulted in fairly clear guidance, leading to immediate changes and direction for preference testing.</p>

    <section class="smBreak"> <!-- tester David -->
      <header>
        <h4 class="headerWithP">David</h4>
        <p>69 years old, male, retired Sales Trainer</p>
      </header>

      <p>David took his time moving through the app, reading carefully and considering things before moving on. He enjoyed the visuals, layouts, and copy in the landing and feature pages.</p>

      <p>In app, David appreciated the presentation and “content flow” of text, color, and layout. He said, “It was great until using the menu. Then I felt like I needed a step-by-step guide,” but, “I like the whole concept of jot &.” He was able to move, delete, and restore items easily, but found uploading difficult.</p>

    <section class="smBreak"> <!-- tester Devin -->
      <header>
        <h4 class="headerWithP">Devin</h4>
        <p>35 years old, male, Welder</p>
      </header>

      <p>Devin found the logo and name slightly confusing at first, until reading the description. He liked the colors of the landing page, which he skimmed quickly. On the Features page, he was confused by the app example images in the hero section. Otherwise, he thought the information in these two pages was easy to digest.</p>

      <p>Devin breezed through onboarding and the tour of jot & with few questions. He was able to navigate the app at a brisk pace, only pausing briefly to figure out how to upload items. Devin described the app as functional, sensible, and user-friendly. He praised its art, colors, and layout. He said he would use the app and share it with others.</p>

    <section class="smBreak"> <!-- tester Wesley -->
      <header>
        <h4 class="headerWithP">Wesley</h4>
        <p>38 years old, male, Video Gamer</p>
      </header>

      <p>Wesley was interested in the landing page. His first thought about the logo was it looked “like a camera”, but at second glance, it also struck him as a clipboard.</p>

      <p>Though he didn’t like the spacing of the feature’s page hero image, but was engaged by the rest.</p>

      <p>Wesley got through the signup and tour processes quickly and without questions. He thought the pages were useful. He was then able to move through the app easily and with little guidance.</p>

      <p>Wesley felt jot & was “relaxed and calm” but also “a little sad,” because the app was so overwhelmingly gray. He suggested adding different colors for file icons, with different colors for each file type.</p>

      <header>
        <h3>Resultant action</h3>
      </header>

      <p>Due to responses to the Feature page’s hero images, I ran preference tests to see if a more open layout would be better received.</p>

      <p>While users appreciated the colors of the feature and landing pages, they were less enthusiastic about the relative lack of color in the app. So I ran preference tests to see if pages could be livened up without causing distraction.</p>

      <p>I adjusted the tour, simplifying micro-copy and reordering screens to give the introduction a better flow. I added ‘back’ buttons, in case someone wanted to reread a section or accidentally moved forward. Boxes were rendered white instead of gray to add to readability and user comprehension. I also positioned arrows more obviously.</p>

      <p>We discovered several bugs in the prototype during testing, such as images not responding to input properly or pages mistakenly loading as overlays. These were fixed afterwards.</p>

    <p>I ran four preference tests, leading to a cleaner and more colorful dashboard and a more intuitive layout for the hero section of the features page.</p>

      <h3>Finishing touches</h3>
    </header>

    <p>In the mockups, I moved ‘sign out’ from the header to the nav bar, underneath ‘trash’, to help keep the user from accidentally signing out and to be consistent with the idea of navigation. I also increased internal consistency in spacing and alignment.</p>

    <p>For the prototype, I made the logo clickable, added a page for search results, adjusted related overlays, and fixed a glitch which made some menu options activate upon hovering.</p>

    <p>I updated the styleguide, adding pages for the colors of file icons and buttons and  a section covering hover and click states for clickable icons and links.</p>
