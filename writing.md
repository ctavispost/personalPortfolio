  <h1>Writing in UX and content</h1>

  <p>I am passionate about service and devoted to strong content and communication.</p>

  <p>As a society, I believe we should strive for better services. We should be inclusive. We should see content, design, and development as partners with a shared mission. We should provide users with clarity and focus while increasing their control, flexibility, and access. And we should treat those users as people deserving of compassion.</p>

  <p>If you share similar thoughts, I would love to work with you towards these goals. <a href="mailto:ctavispost@gmail.com">Send me a note.</a></p>
